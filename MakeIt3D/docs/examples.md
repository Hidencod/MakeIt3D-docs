## Contributing Examples

Have you created something amazing with MakeIt3D? We'd love to feature your work! Here's how you can contribute:

1. **Create** your example project with clear, commented events
2. **Test** thoroughly across different devices and browsers  
3. **Document** your approach with helpful comments
4. **Submit** via our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/your-repo) or [Discord community](https://discord.gg/BPmX5mgkkv)

### Example Guidelines

- **Keep it focused**: Each example should demonstrate 1-2 specific features
- **Add comments**: Explain complex logic in your event sheets
- **Optimize performance**: Ensure smooth 60fps on mid-range devices
- **Include assets**: Provide all necessary textures, models, and sounds
- **Test compatibility**: Verify it works on mobile and desktop

:::tip Pro Tip
The best examples start simple and gradually introduce complexity. Consider creating a series of related examples that build upon each other!
